/*==============================================================
Problem 2. Detect if two integers have opposite signs or not
The expression output x ^ y is negative 
if x and y have opposite signs. 
We know that for a positive number, the leftmost bit is 0, and for a negative number, it is 1. 
Now for similar sign integers, the XOR operator 
will set the leftmost bit of output as 0, and for opposite sign integers, it will set the leftmost bit as 1
